/**
 * DELETE /api/admin/content-warnings/[id]
 *
 * Deletes a specific content warning by its ID. Can perform either soft delete
 * (deactivation) or hard delete depending on usage and requirements.
 * Requires admin authentication.
 *
 * Route Parameters:
 * @param {string} id - Content warning ID
 *
 * Query Parameters:
 * @param {boolean} [force=false] - Force hard delete even if used by shows
 *
 * Response:
 * {
 *   success: boolean,
 *   data: {
 *     contentWarning: {
 *       id: string,
 *       name: string,
 *       isActive: boolean,
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * Deletion Rules:
 * - Soft delete (isActive = false) if warning is used by active shows
 * - Hard delete only if no shows use this warning or force = true
 * - Maintains data integrity by preserving historical associations
 *
 * Process:
 * 1. Authenticates admin user
 * 2. Validates content warning ID and existence
 * 3. Checks if warning is used by any shows
 * 4. Determines deletion strategy (soft vs hard)
 * 5. Performs deletion operation
 * 6. Returns deletion confirmation
 *
 * Restrictions:
 * - Cannot hard delete if used by published shows (unless forced)
 * - Soft deletion preferred to maintain data integrity
 *
 * Error Responses:
 * - 400: Invalid content warning ID
 * - 401: Authentication required
 * - 403: Insufficient permissions (admin access required)
 * - 404: Content warning not found
